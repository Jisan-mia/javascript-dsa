// binary tree rule

/* 
- each node can only have either 0,1 or 2 nodes
- and each child can have only one parents
- lookup O(log N)
- insert O(log N)
- delete O(log N)
*/

/* 
"Binary Search Tree" is a subset of binary tree
- its really good at searching
rules:
- all child nodes in the tree to the right of the root node must be greater than the current node
- all child nodes in the tree to the left of the root node must be less than the current node
- all right side child nodes increases
- all left side child nodes decreases
