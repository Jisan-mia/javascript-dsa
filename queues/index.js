// Queues is another linear Data structure
// Queue is the opposite of stack
// we can compare queue with a line of people in front of an atm machine, where people stand in the line to withdraw/deposit money in the atm
// in this line, the person who comes first or first in the line can withdraw/deposit money first in atm
// queue works the same, and the above process called FIFO(First In First Out)
// because, one who comes in first, it's the first item to come out


/* Popular methods of Queue
- lookup O(n)
- enqueue  O(1) 
- dequeue O(1)
- peek O(1) // the first item that came in
